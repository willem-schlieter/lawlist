# Requested changes in review process
- [x] Move source files to `src`
- [x] Clean up the generated stylesheet.
- [x] Remove settings heading.
- [x] Change counter color in Edit Mode to list-marker-color.
- [x] Instead of styling every single LI and cluttering the document with stylesheets, use @counter-style.
    - Problem: In Read Mode, the OLs' indentation levels are detected by CSS selectors "ol ol ol" and "ol ol ol ol"â€¦
    - This is why the numbering style differs from the one in Edit Mode. In Edit Mode, indentation level counts OL and UL
    - parents, in Read Mode, it only counts OL parents.
- [x] Limit of counters to 15:
    - Increased to 26.
    - Handled the case of overflow by falling back to "1. " instead of throwing an uncought exception.
    - Inserted a note in README.
    - (Completely removing this limit would require a major change to how patterns are handled. This shall be left for some later upgrades.)
- [ ] Enhance plugin <> editor extension communication by passing arguments into the View Plugin constructor - does not work, see main.ts line 43.
