# Requested changes in review process
- [x] Move source files to `src`
- [x] Clean up the generated stylesheet.
- [x] Remove settings heading.
- [x] Change counter color in Edit Mode to list-marker-color.
- [x] Instead of styling every single LI and cluttering the document with stylesheets, use @counter-style.
- [ ] Limit of counters to 15:
    - Increased to 26.
    - Handled the case of overflow by falling back to "1. " instead of throwing an uncought exception.
    - Inserted a note in README.
    - (Completely removing this limit would require a major change to how patterns are handled. This shall be left for some later upgrades.)
    - (Problem) Inconsistent styling of list items above 26 in Read Mode <> Edit Mode.
- [x] Enhance plugin <> editor extension communication by passing arguments into the View Plugin constructor.
